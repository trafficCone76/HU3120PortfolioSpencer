                        Try to think about the assignment's audience and how revisions would help them.) </b><br>
                    For the proposal, I revised grammar and spelling to ensure clarity and consistency throughout 
                    the document. I had not noticed that the proposal had zero sections that mentioned the figures, 
                    leaving it all up to the primary audience inferring their use. Pointing this out in the feedback 
                    let me know to add mentions of the figures at appropriate points in the text. I did ensure I would 
                    have the references match the content they support. Doing this had me find out that the current locations 
                    of the figures felt more random than I expected. To remedy this I moved the locations of the figures to better 
                    reflect when I mentioned them in the writing and where they would support the section nearest, improving the 
                    flow and coherence of the figures. I also added clarifying sentences in multiple sections to reduce the feeling 
                    of clunkiness and enhance overall readability, making the transitions between sections smoother and more natural. 
                    I also found I never fully explained why I chose the route itself. Thus I implemented clarifications for my 
                    reasonings in the solution section of the proposal.

                    <b>2. Were there any changes that you received feedback on and didn't incorporate? Why?</b><br>
                    There was no feedback I decided not to incorporate. I did not see a large amount of feedback, 
                    thus, any feedback skipped would result in a minimal amount of changes in the document, hindering the revision.

                    I fixed a large number of grammatical errors and misspellings. 
                    I also changed the steps to show “Step x” and “substep x” based on the feedback. This did lead to issues, 
                    as mentioned in emails, when the clarifications are added to the numbering system word automatically adds a large
                    amount of padding between the "step x" and step description.
                    On top of this, I bolded the Steps to help readability and added a space after each step; 
                    no space was added between step and substep to help the connection between each step be made subconsciously. 

                    <br><br>
                    <b>2. Were there any changes that you received feedback on and didn't incorporate? Why?</b><br>
                    I did not incorporate the feedback to add images to the major instructions. I decided against 
                    this as, while it would be helpful, I ran into a multitude of issues getting the formatting and 
                    flow for the document to not get interrupted or fully break with the added images. For example I 
                    tried to add an image of the shifter so the reader would EXACTLY what to interact with. When adding 
                    it I tried adding it inline but it broke the flow of the document, and when adding to the sides it 
                    got confusing which image correlated to which step. I also had my girlfriend run through the steps, 
                    one version with the images, and one without. The feedback I received was that the steps without 
                    images were easier to go through, but harder to visualize what was needed. She also mentioned the 
                    version with images containing too many images, while helpful, it made it confusing exactly what 
                    she was looking for in each image. She also mentioned she still preferred it without images. Thus 
                    I chose to omit images, whilst I understand the document would be better with images, I have not figured 
                    out how to properly implement images without cluttering the document or making it worse to go through.

                    I also incorporated more information as to why certain calculations are used, 
                    such as only running for 6 hours a day, this was done due to the first year 
                    being a research study, which means there is not a fully investment and reduced hours.
